I am planning to perform numerical relativity simulations of binary systems of neutron stars and/or black holes in order to study the gravitational waves they emit during the inspiral, merger and ringdown phases. 

For this project I will constrain the orbits to be perfectly circular and reproduce results obtained by previous numerical relativity simulations. I will also generate 3-D visualizations of the evolution of the orbits along with the gravitational waves emitted in all directions. 

I will then compare the waveforms generated by these simulations with the semi-analytic models of the gravitational waves that I have previously developed with Eliu Huerta as well as with the gravitational waveforms that LIGO has already detected (and may detect in the future). 

I will be using the Einstein toolkit which is built on top of the open-source Cactus Framework. I have already installed and tested the software on the campus cluster at UIUC. Furthermore, I will be making my code freely available to the public.

As my current research at NCSA focuses on studying systems with initially eccentric orbits, I plan to further develop the code to include eccentricities.
